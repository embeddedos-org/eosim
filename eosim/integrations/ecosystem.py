"""EoS Ecosystem Runner — build and test every EoS repo through EoSim.

Discovery is by inspection, not by a hardcoded list: any immediate
subdirectory of the workspace holding a ``.git`` is a repo, and its build
system is detected from the files it actually contains. A new product becomes
testable by being cloned into the workspace, with no change here.

Nothing in this module infers a pass. A repo that could not be tested reports
SKIP with the reason, never PASS -- an unrunnable suite and a green suite are
different facts and the report keeps them apart.
